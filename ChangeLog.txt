Update history:

--Aug 2 2020--
	added arg parsing
	hybridization function file name is now the program input and no longer read from params file
	added verbose mode (use -v flag)
	edited printing messages
	quiet flag will no longer suppress error messages
	
--Aug 3 2020--
	Tested CPU/GPU version with intel/gnu compilers
	Makefile edited
	
--Aug 15 2020--
	Added "Hybrid_Bisection" method (a hybrid of secant and bisection method) to determine mu0, replacing Amoeba (basically bisection). This method has the benefit of faster convergence (secant-like) with the safety of bisection. This can potentially cut code running time (non-PH symmetric case) for 50% or more.
	Removed some unnecessary printout when -v flag is not supplied
	
	
--Aug 17 2020--
	Make some changes to SIAM::get_SOCSigma() such that cubic spline is only initiated when requested, and only once instead of being unnecessarily looped over.
	Added cubic spline mode to gpu evaluations of P1, P2 and imSOCSigma (The global switch is "usecubicspline")

--Aug 18 2020--
	Added cubic spline mode to cpu version
	
--Aug 19 2020--
	Added MPI mode (The binary is IPT-mpi). Fixed a bug in CPU version of code.
